# ADR-0001: Names and links only; the overlay is built from the pinned image

## Context
GZA ships to gateways as an overlay on a pinned upstream image, built byte for byte by
grandeursmart-zigbee-automation `gza/build_libs.py`.

## Selected proposal
This branch carries the upstream sources with the GZA names (`gza-core`) and GS repository links only.
`zigbee-herdsman` stays as a compatibility identifier where lockfiles and upstream tooling need it. LICENSE and
copyright notices are unchanged. Code changes for GZA go through the overlay build and its tests.
